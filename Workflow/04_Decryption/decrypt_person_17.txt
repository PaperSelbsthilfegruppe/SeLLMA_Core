## Reference Letter for Anna

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing to recommend Anna for any opportunity where her strong interpersonal skills, dedication, and passion for helping others would be valuable.

While Anna may not possess a formal school leaving certificate, her dedication to personal growth is evident in her recent pursuit of professional reorientation. Her willingness to learn and adapt is commendable.

Furthermore, Anna is a highly engaged individual who actively contributes to her community. Her involvement with the local refugee assistance and Seniorenheim demonstrates her compassion and commitment to making a positive impact.

Her comfort with technology, gained through independent learning, further highlights her adaptability and willingness to embrace new challenges.

I am confident that Anna would be a valuable asset to any team.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
