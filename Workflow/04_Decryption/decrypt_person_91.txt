To Whom It May Concern,

It is with pleasure that I recommend Hermann for any opportunity that aligns with his skills and enthusiasm.

While Hermann may not have a traditional school leaving certificate, his dedication to learning is evident. He has gained valuable experience through hands-on work and self-directed learning, demonstrating a strong commitment to personal and professional growth.

Although Hermann has primarily worked as a self-employed individual and in part-time roles, his diverse experiences have equipped him with valuable transferable skills. He is a quick learner, adaptable to new environments, and possesses a strong work ethic.

Beyond his professional endeavors, Hermann is actively engaged in his community. His involvement with the local sports club highlights his team spirit and dedication to contributing to a positive social environment.

Furthermore, Hermann has a passion for technology.  He is a self-proclaimed "tech nerd" with considerable experience using computers and software, and he is eager to expand his knowledge in this area.

I am confident that Hermann would be a valuable asset to your organization. He is a dedicated, resourceful individual with a strong desire to learn and contribute. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions.

Sincerely,

Your HR Assistant
