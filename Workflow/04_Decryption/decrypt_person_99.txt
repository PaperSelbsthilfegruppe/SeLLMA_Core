To Whom It May Concern,

It is with great pleasure that I recommend Elena for any suitable opportunity. I have had the privilege of knowing Elena for several years through her commendable work with a local association dedicated to supporting homeless individuals.

Despite not having a formal school leaving certificate, Elena has consistently demonstrated remarkable dedication and a strong work ethic. Her extensive professional experience across various industries is a testament to her adaptability and willingness to learn. 

Her commitment to social responsibility is truly inspiring. Elena has been an invaluable asset to the association, contributing significantly to meal organization and care provision for those in need.

While Elena possesses basic computer and internet skills, her exceptional interpersonal skills, strong work ethic, and dedication make her a valuable asset to any team.

I am confident that Elena will make a significant contribution to your organization. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
