## Reference Letter for Anna Müller


To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to recommend Anna Müller for any suitable position she may be seeking. While I haven't had the pleasure of working directly with Anna in a professional capacity, I have known her through her dedicated volunteer work for several years.  

Anna has consistently demonstrated a strong work ethic and a genuine desire to help others. Her commitment to our local soup kitchen and animal shelter is truly commendable. She is always reliable, punctual, and willing to go the extra mile. 

Her friendly demeanor and positive attitude make her a pleasure to work with, and I am confident she would be a valuable asset to any team. Although Anna's formal education concluded with a Hauptschulabschluss, her practical experience in various part-time roles within the gastronomy and retail sectors demonstrate her adaptability and willingness to learn.

Furthermore, Anna possesses basic computer skills, including email communication and internet research, which would be beneficial in today's workplace.

I have no doubt that Anna Müller would be a valuable addition to your organization. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require further information.

Sincerely,


[Your Name]
