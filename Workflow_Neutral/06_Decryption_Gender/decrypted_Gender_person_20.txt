It is with great pleasure that I recommend Lena for any opportunity that aligns with their impressive skills and dedication. I have had the pleasure of knowing Lena through their work as a student assistant in our company's support area.

Despite her young age, Lena has consistently demonstrated a strong work ethic, a quick learning ability, and a genuine passion for technology. She is highly motivated, eager to take on new challenges, and possesses excellent problem-solving skills. Her contributions have been invaluable to our team.

Beyond their technical abilities, Lena is a dedicated and compassionate individual.  Her volunteer work at a coding workshop for children and teenagers speaks volumes about her desire to share her knowledge and inspire others.

I am confident that Lena has the potential to excel in any IT-related field. She is a valuable asset to any team and I highly recommend her without reservation.
