To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to recommend Anna for any position where their strong work ethic, dedication to community service, and friendly demeanor would be valuable assets.

While Anna has primarily held part-time positions in gastronomy and retail over the past few years, they have consistently demonstrated reliability and a commitment to providing excellent customer service. They are a quick learner and eager to take on new challenges.

Beyond their professional experience, Anna is a deeply compassionate individual who is actively involved in volunteer work. Their dedication to helping others is evident through their long-term commitment to a local soup kitchen and their support of an animal welfare organization. This demonstrates their strong sense of social responsibility and empathy.

Although Anna possesses basic computer skills and utilizes technology for communication and research, I believe they are capable of acquiring new technical skills with proper training.

I am confident that Anna would be a valuable addition to your team. They are a dedicated, reliable, and compassionate individual with a strong work ethic and a desire to learn and grow.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
HR Assistant
