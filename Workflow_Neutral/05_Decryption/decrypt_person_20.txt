To Whom It May Concern:

It is with great pleasure that I recommend Lena for any opportunity that aligns with their impressive skills and dedication. I have had the pleasure of knowing Lena  through their work as a student assistant in our company's support area.

Despite their young age, Lena has consistently demonstrated a strong work ethic, a quick learning ability, and a genuine passion for technology. They are highly motivated, eager to take on new challenges, and possess excellent problem-solving skills. Their contributions have been invaluable to our team.

Beyond their technical abilities, Lena is a dedicated and compassionate individual. Their volunteer work at a coding workshop for children and teenagers speaks volumes about their desire to share their knowledge and inspire others.

I am confident that Lena  has the potential to excel in any IT-related field. They are a valuable asset to any team and I highly recommend them without reservation.


Sincerely,
